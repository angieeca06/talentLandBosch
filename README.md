##FFinal Presentation:
When it comes to buying auto parts, the process can be as fast and efficient as the customer is, or as painfully, slow and tedious as the customer is willing before asking for help to the sales agent on a classic auto shop; that can be due many reasons but most of the times it’s because a false shame feeling based on previous occasions requiring help, asking many questions or just not knowing exactly what do you need. Thinking about that and adding the waiting times, the need to go to the store plus finding a parking slot can turn a joyful buying experience into a really uncomfortable situation. That’s where the online stores shine. In order to reach that excellence standard they get help from their teams of experts on different fields, but many of them need to hire offshore call centers to help the customer get what they want and that also has some drawbacks many times like the wait time on line to get help from a person, or wait for the auto menu to say the options and pressing the correct number for that, a bad phone signal or just not being able to hear what the other person says clearly turning the whole experience into an unpleasant process.

So, what if we could find a tool to make that task more efficient and enjoyable for the customer? 

That is already available as a chatbot!. It becomes an ideal solution to automate the process, save time and reduce costs to any company as it is not necessary to pay staff to perform the job; that most of the times do not need the interaction with a person, adding the advantage of being available 24 to the day 7 days of the week.

We are implementing on a Facebook page our Chatbot - BoschBot from now on-.

In addition to the previous perks of using a chatbot, we added the option to request and show the schematic diagram for any piece that has one available cause many times the user does not know exactly the year or model of a vehicle but if he has the possibility of physically measuring a certain part or check the connections to it he can even find the right piece at times when the Model number from the piece is missing. This way the user will have the certainty that it is the auto part he needs. 

After all of the previous comments the most important feature is that the customer can do the interaction with BoschBot at his own pace without feeling being rushed.
